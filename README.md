# OBJECT-DETECTION
This is a object detection proogram. 
I have used YOLO algorithm, with the config model file and frozen model file. obtained from github.  
Then the programs identifies the object when the config file and frozen model identifies an object
Output can be predicted for both image and video and even on a webcam live detection.
